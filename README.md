This repository contains the source code, some initial data, and basic outputs of the unified genetic classification system of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma.  It is meant to be a representation of how we arrived at the unified classifier and it's predictive model, and to indicate all the steps used to generate clustering matrix, select features for ML model, and to illustrate all the filtering steps we used along the way.

This repository is not meant to be used as a standalone script or package. The front end system that will classify individual samples and compare the per-sample label of the new data to other existing classifiers is under development and will be released later.
